To build from the git repo, you will need to install the autotools (autoconf,
libtool, and automake), asciidoctor, rcs, and probably other packages that I am
forgetting about at the moment.  It will be simpler to download a source
tarball and build from that.  As I write this document there are no
official source tarballs since no official release has yet been made, so
acaqiring a source tarball will be problematic.  Perhaps a release will be
made in the near future.

This package is intended to be usable in the standard way.  If you have
met all the dependencies, just cd into the top level directory and run 'make'.
This is a slight divergence from the usual autoconfiscated package, but should
work.  The git repo includes a Makefile,v which 'make' should recognize.  The
initial invocation of make will checkout a Makefile (using rcs) from the
Makefile,v which will be used to generate a build directory and run the typical
command chain.  If you don't want to abuse the autotools this way, just ignore
the Makefile,v and run:

autoreconf -ivf
./configure --prefix=/p/a/t/h
make


The test suite is currently fragile.  At the moment, it mostly works in
a debian docker image on macos, but breaks completely elsewhere.  In the
debian docker image, typically 1 or 2 of the 51 tests will fail.  IOW,
don't expect 'make check' to be reliable.
