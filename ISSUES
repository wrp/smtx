BUGS:
	Test suite is broken.  Tests sporadically pass in a debian docker image
	on macos, but I get consistent failures in other platforms.

	Syntax highlighting doesn't work in vim.

	This is dog slow on macos.  top regularly reports 100% cpu.  Should
	stop using select and switch to kqueue.  Probably not worth the
	effort to use libevent or libev.

	Need to handle memory allocation errors more thoroughly.

	Make tput rep work.  eg, tput rep w 5 should write 5 'w' to term,
	but the parameters do not seem to be getting sent properly.  We get
	argc == 1 and argv[0] == 5 - 1, but the w is chomped.  Note that this
	is the only terminfo entry that uses %c, and I suspect there is a bug
	in vtparser

	Figure out why I am getting an extra line at the bottom of screen in
	termux.  Note this happens outside of smtx, so it is not our bug to
	fix, but may be a terminfo issue.  It needs to be understood.

	As of 61c41fe0f1dd73829315c959b69cf44df2af102f, the test suite hangs
	on macos.  Note that all the tests in esctest.py also timeout.

	test_ich consistently fails on macos.  This seems to
	be an issue with terminfo.  On macos:
	$ infocmp $TERM | grep '\<dl\>'
	        dl=\E[%p1%dM, dl1=\E[M, ech=\E[%p1%dX, ed=\E[J, el=\E[K,
		$ tput dl 5 | xxd
		00000000: 1b5b 4d                                  .[M
	but on debian:
	$ infocmp $TERM | grep '\<dl\>'
	        dl=\E[%p1%dM, dl1=\E[M, ech=\E[%p1%dX, ed=\E[J, el=\E[K,
		$ tput dl 5 | xxd
		00000000: 1b5b 354d                                .[5M
	tput is not passing the parameter, so test ich on macos only deletes
	one line.

	Title bars are wonky with zero height canvas.

	csr does not work well with multple canvasses.	Probably the
	correct thing to do is to remove csr functionality.
