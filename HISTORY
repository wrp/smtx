A quick jaunt down memory lane before I forget.  What is the motivation for smtx?

Originally, I was annoyed at the diffculty of pane management in
tmux.  I would typically only use one pane per window, with
occasionally (rarely) 2 panes.  It is just too difficult to manipulate
panes.  I experimented with dvtm, and got as far as
https://github.com/wrp/dvtm/tree/mvtm but was not happy with where
that was going.   In the process of that hacking, I realized that
what I wanted was modes.  I shifted over to using mtm because the
code base is simpler. While hacking at that, I discovered that I
really wanted to be able to scroll horizontally in a window and be
able to use the multiplexer on my phone, so I needed the pty to be
wider than the physical screen.  (A few days after those realizations,
Linus announced a style change in the linux kernel and that 80
columns would no longer be mandated.  Such a style change only makes
sense if the tools exist to make it easy to scroll horizontally,
so horizontal scrolling and not tying the pty width to the physcial
device become imporant) Also, I played around with different behaviors
of keystrokes in various modes.  Pretty sure now that what I want
is the ability to easily swap out keybindings.  Right now, playing
with the idea of having one keybinding in which '<>' will scroll
the pty horizontally while all other keys pass through.  Also have
a mode in which hjkl is used to navigate.  But the key is that it
must be very simple to change key bindings to make the terminal
usable on a device with limited keyboard (like termux on Android).
